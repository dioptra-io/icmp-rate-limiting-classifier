# Limited Ltd.

Limited Ltd. is a new tool for performing alias resolution, the task to group IP addresses into routers.
It is based on ICMP rate limiting.



## Getting Started

The software is composed of two components, the prober (written in C++) and the classifier written in Python 3.

To get the prober:
```
git clone https://gitlab.planet-lab.eu/cartography/icmp-rate-limiting.git
```

To get the classifier:

```
git clone https://gitlab.planet-lab.eu/cartography/icmp-rate-limiting-classifier.git
```
